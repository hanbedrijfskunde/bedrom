   - Materials section completely non-functional
   - Shows 404 error instead of preparation materials
   - Critical for student preparation

### Medium Severity Issues (2)

   - Multiple identical notifications appear on role selection
   - Creates visual clutter
   - Confuses users

   - Minor UX issue
   - Timer still functional

## Feature Test Results

### ✅ Working Features
- Navigation menu (desktop and mobile)
- Role selection with sub-role selection
- Team creation with unique codes (e.g., WOAO5O)
- Progress tracking (0% → 14% → 29%)
- Settings modal
- Data export functionality (JSON backup)
- Timer with phase management
- Mobile responsive design
- Skip to content accessibility link
- Keyboard navigation basics

### ⚠️ Partially Working Features
- Notification system (works but shows duplicates)
- Modal management (works but doesn't close properly)
- Route handling (most routes work, materials route broken)

### ❌ Broken Features
- Materials page (404 error)
- Preparation page (empty content)
- Missing manifest.json icons (404 errors in console)

## Performance Observations
- Initial load time: Fast (<1 second)
- Service Worker: Registered successfully
- Caching: Working (v4 cache active)
- Console warnings:
  - Tailwind CDN production warning (expected)
  - Missing icon files (images/icon-192.png)

## Accessibility Findings
- ✅ Skip to content link present and functional
- ✅ ARIA labels on buttons
- ✅ Keyboard navigation with Tab key works
- ✅ Mobile menu accessible
- ⚠️ Focus indicators could be more visible
- ⚠️ No screen reader testing performed

## Mobile Responsiveness
- ✅ Responsive at 375px (mobile)
- ✅ Responsive at 768px (tablet)
- ✅ Responsive at 1024px (desktop)
- ✅ Mobile menu appears and functions correctly
- ✅ Content reflows properly

## Data Management
- ✅ LocalStorage persistence working
- ✅ Progress saved automatically
- ✅ Export functionality creates valid JSON
- ✅ State management tracking changes
- ⚠️ Import functionality not tested

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Fix Materials page** - Implement missing route handler
2. **Fix duplicate notifications** - Debug event listeners
3. **Close modals after success** - Add modal.close() logic

### Improvements Suggested
1. Add content to Preparation page
2. Update timer button to show pause state
3. Add missing icon files
4. Improve error handling for 404 routes
5. Add loading states for async operations

### Future Enhancements
1. Add offline functionality testing
2. Implement comprehensive accessibility testing
3. Add E2E test automation suite
4. Performance monitoring
5. Cross-browser testing (Firefox, Safari)

## Test Environment
- **Browser**: Chromium (via Playwright)
- **Viewport**: 1024x768 (primary), 375x667 (mobile)
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Node Version**: As per environment
- **Test Framework**: Playwright MCP

## Conclusion
The application is **mostly functional** with a **good foundation** but requires attention to fix the Materials section and resolve UI/UX issues. The core student journey (role selection → team creation → timer) works, but the preparation materials are inaccessible, which is critical for the assessment preparation purpose.

**Overall Score: 7/10**
- Stability: 8/10
- Functionality: 6/10 (Materials section broken)
- UI/UX: 7/10
- Accessibility: 7/10
- Mobile Support: 9/10

## Next Steps
1. Fix high-priority issues (Materials page)
2. Resolve medium-priority UI bugs
3. Conduct user acceptance testing
4. Add automated regression tests
5. Deploy fixes and retest
