# Issue: Team Creation Modal Not Closing After Success

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2024-01-09T10:45:00Z
- **Test**: Team Coordination Flow
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Category**: UI/UX

## Description
After successfully creating a team, the team creation modal remains open in the background while the team dashboard is displayed. This creates a confusing layered interface where both the form and the success screen are visible simultaneously.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5502/toetsing.html
2. Click on "Team" in navigation
3. Click "Team Aanmaken" button
4. Fill in all required fields
5. Click "Team Aanmaken" submit button
6. Observe that modal remains open behind the team dashboard

## Expected Behavior
The modal should close automatically after successful team creation, showing only the team dashboard.

## Actual Behavior
Both the team dashboard and the team creation modal are visible, with the modal appearing behind the dashboard content.

## Environment
- Browser: Chromium (Playwright)
- Viewport: Default
- Device: Desktop

## Evidence
- Team was created successfully (Code: WOAO5O)
- Progress updated to 29%
- Success notification appeared
- Modal form still visible in DOM (refs e182-e199)

## Suggested Fix
Add logic to close/hide the modal after successful team creation. Either:
1. Remove the modal from DOM after success
2. Add a display:none or hidden class to the modal
3. Implement proper modal state management
