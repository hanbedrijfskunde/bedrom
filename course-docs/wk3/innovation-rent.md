### Profit Maximization and Normal Profit

A firm producing a differentiated product maximizes its profit by choosing the price and quantity where the highest possible isoprofit curve is tangent to the demand curve[cite: 1647, 2316].

The profit calculated at this point is **economic profit**, which is the revenue a firm receives minus its total costs, including the opportunity cost of capital[cite: 2220]. The opportunity cost of capital is considered a **normal profit**, which is the minimum return required by shareholders to keep their funds invested in the company[cite: 2218, 2221]. A firm earning zero economic profit is earning normal profits[cite: 2221, 2229].

Therefore, the profit at the tangency point is the return *in excess* of the normal profit required to compensate owners and cover the cost of capital. In a stable market without innovation, competition would tend to reduce this economic profit towards zero.

### Innovation Rent

You are also correct that an innovative technology or business idea allows an innovator to earn a higher compensation than others. This additional profit is called an **innovation rent** (or Schumpeterian rent)[cite: 3321].

This rent is the profit an innovator earns that is above the opportunity cost of capital[cite: 3238, 3321]. These rents are the reward for introducing the innovation, but they are temporary[cite: 3352]. As other firms copy the innovation, competition increases, and the innovation rents are eventually competed away[cite: 3239, 3352].
