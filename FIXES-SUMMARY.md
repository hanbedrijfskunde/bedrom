## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Infinite Loop Error (Maximum call stack size exceeded)

**Problem:** The application was crashing with a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error due to an infinite loop between `calculateProgress()` and `updateUI()`.

**Root Cause:**
- `calculateProgress()` was calling `set('progress.overall', percentage)`
- This triggered a 'state:changed' event
- The event listener called `updateUI()`
- `updateUI()` called `calculateProgress()` again
- Creating an infinite loop

**Solution:**
1. Made `calculateProgress()` a pure function that only returns the value
2. Added `isUpdatingUI` flag to prevent recursive UI updates
3. Added error handling in state change listeners
4. Filtered out 'progress.overall' changes from triggering UI updates

**Files Modified:**
- `/js/core/state-manager.js` - Removed `set()` call from `calculateProgress()`
- `/js/core/app.js` - Added recursion prevention and error handling

### 2. ✅ Settings Button Not Working

**Problem:** The settings button was visible but clicking it didn't open the modal.

**Root Cause:**
- The settings.js module was checking if a button with id='settings-button' existed
- If it existed, it would return early without attaching event listeners
- The HTML already had a settings button, so no click handler was attached

**Solution:**
- Modified `createSettingsButton()` to attach event listeners to existing buttons
- Now properly handles both pre-existing and dynamically created buttons

**File Modified:**
- `/js/components/settings.js` - Fixed button initialization logic

### 3. ✅ Reset Functionality Verified

- Settings button opens modal ✅
- Modal displays current progress ✅
- Reset button shows confirmation dialog ✅
- LocalStorage is cleared after confirmation ✅
- Success notification appears ✅
- Page reloads with clean state ✅
